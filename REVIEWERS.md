# How to perform your code review

* On [github](https://github.com), go to the folder of the person whose code you are reviewing.  Note that I have included the pointer arrow in these screenshots to show you what, exactly, to click on:

    ![step1](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1/blob/master/images/step1.png)

* Once you are in their folder, click on the "commit hash" in the upper right hand corner (`1b97034` in this example):

    ![step2](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1/blob/master/images/step2.png)

* Scroll down to the very bottom of the page.  You will see a comment box:

    ![step3](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1/blob/master/images/step3.png)

* Now, in a new broswer tab, open up the [RUBRIC.md](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1/blob/master/RUBRIC.md) for [assignment-1](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1):

    ![step4](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1/blob/master/images/step4.png)

* We're going to copy the raw text of this file (not the part that github has rendered to make it pretty).  Click on the `Raw` button:

    ![step5](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1/blob/master/images/step5.png)

* Clicking on the `Raw` button will take you to the raw text.  Copy that raw text:

    ![step6](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1/blob/master/images/step6.png)

* After copying that text, return to the first browser tab, which should be at the bottom of the submission you are grading. Paste the text into this box that you copied:

    ![step7](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1/blob/master/images/step7.png)

* Click the `Comment on this commit` to render the text you pasted into check boxes.

    ![step8](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1/blob/master/images/step8.png)

* Work through the code that you are grading, making sure that the answers are correct **according to the RUBRIC.md**.  You may even need to update your copy of the cloned assignment-1 directory so that you can check the code you are grading.  **If you don't understand how something is working, it's best to test it - it might not be correct**:

    ![step9](https://github.com/biolprogramming/assignment-1/blob/master/images/step9.png)

* You are finished.  Proceed to your 2nd code review.
