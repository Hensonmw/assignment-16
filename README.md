## Task 1

Starting with `assignment-9` (or any later assignment), pick the code from one of the tasks that you wrote and write a set of unit tests that test each function in your program.  You may need to slightly refactor your older code to work with your units tests (although you shouldn't have to change very much).  Be sure to use `unittest` and include a `unittest.main()` call in your `ifmain` loop.  Also be sure to format your code correctly.

## Task 2

Write a program that does something you need (or want) for it to do.  The program can do anything, but it should have between 5 and 10 functions (or more, if you really want).  You should also write a separate set of unit tests for your program to test that *each function* is performing as you would expect.  You may use any sort of input data you like (your own, someone elses, etc.).  If you want some data you could do stuff with, there are many sources online... one of my recent favorites is this set of [natural history traits of different organisms](http://esapubs.org/archive/ecol/E096/269/#data).

*Be sure* to trim your input data file to a reasonable size before committing it to your repository (git does not like to store large, unchanging, files).  Please also include, in a `README.md` file in your repository, a description of what your program does and how to use it.
